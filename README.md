## Walk-through Steps

### Step 1 â€“ Create Two Virtual Machines

### Step 3 â€“ Create 1,000 Users in AD with PowerShell
If you haven't already, download the PowerShell script: [DOWNLOAD NOW](#).

1. Extract the zip file on your host PC.
2. COPY the **AD_PS-master** folder from your host PC then go to the Windows Server 2016 virtual machine and PASTE. It really that simple trust me.


3. Open **PowerShell ISE** as an administrator and load the `1_CREATE_USERS` file from the **AD_PS-master** folder.
4. Run the following commands before executing the script:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   cd C:\Users\a-egade\Desktop\AD_PS-master
   ls
   ```

   - `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` (This allows the script to run without restrictions.)
   - `cd` to the correct folder location where the script is saved.
   - `ls` to verify the files in the folder.

5. Click the **Play** button in PowerShell ISE to run the script.

Your code should look something like this when creating new users:


### Step 4 â€“ Join Windows Clients to the Domain
To join the client machine to the domain:

1. Ensure both the client and domain controller (DC) server are on the same **NIC (Network Interface Card).**
2. Once logged into the client machine, open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and run:
   ```cmd
   ipconfig
   ping mydomain.com
   ```
   - This verifies network settings and connectivity to the domain server.
   - The result should be as followed in the image.

3. Open **Settings > System > About > Rename this PC (Advanced) > Change.**
4. Under **Member of**, select **Domain** and enter **mydomain.com**.
5. Click **OK**, then enter your **Domain Controller (DC) credentials** when prompted.

### Step 5 â€“ Log in to the Client Machine with a Created User
Now that all the steps are complete, we will test logging into the client machine with one of the created accounts:

1. Log out of the client machine.
2. Select **Other Users.**
3. Log in using one of the generated AD accounts for example below:
   
   - **Username:** `aabrev`  
   - **Password:** `Password1`

If you can successfully log in with the AD account, your lab setup is complete! Additionally, since we configured **RAS/NAT**, the client machine should have internet access through the domain controller.
